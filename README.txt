Hello, to run our application, clone the repo in Xcode. Since we were not able to implement the Firebase backend properly yet, you will need to manually switch 'status' boolean value to see the login/register screen and other content of the application. 
In the ContentView.swift file, on line 28, the 'status' state boolean should be 'true' if you want to view the homescreen with the tabs for the app's key features.
The status boolean should be 'false' if you want to see the login/register screens.
